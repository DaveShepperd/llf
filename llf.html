  <em>Note from Dave Shepperd, 8/2022
  <p>
  There never were any release notes kept on this application so there is no record of what got changed when. It just is what it is.
  I wrote the PDP11/RT11 version in the late 1976 and the current C version in probably 1982 or 1983. It continued to get development until the late 1990's
    and continues to get bug fixes to this day.
    </p>
    <p>
    Recently I got involved in rebuilding some of old Atari coin-op game code (some of which recently
    was released on github) and wanted to use this tool to make ROM/EPROM images and to test them with MAME. This prompted me to port the documentation,
    what little there is, of the three main applications used to build game images to HTML. Those tools are the assembler (macxx), linker (llf)
    and rom image maker (mixit).
    Although I wrote the original documentation (llf.doc) for this linker, I am neither a technical writer nor am I any good at HTML5. As might be evidenced
    with the original documentation, I quickly lose interest in writing technical documents and don't check things too closely. So good luck
    making sense of anything written here. Feel free to hack this document into something more readable. If you do, please send me a copy.
  </p>
    <p>If one cares, I wrote a little history about how this linker and the other two tools came to be. It can be found
    <a href="#history">HERE</a>.
